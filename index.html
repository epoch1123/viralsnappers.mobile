            <h2>Kolkata,India</h2>
            <p>There's a small manifestation of miscarriage <br>
                Miscarriage of dereliction <br>
                Amidst the taste of a whole curated platter <br>
                Resides an odour <br>
                Odour of remembrance <br>
                The great gurus once said, "You feel what you love" <br>
                I feel hurt, ignored <br>
                But I don't love hurt and ignorance <br>
                Change is inevitable my friend <br>
                The good or bad seems trivial <br>
                What matters is the change. <br>
                But still when I take a deep breath <br>
                And let that breath touch every inner corner of my wrinkled body <br>
                I feel the ecstasy, <br>
                I feel the euphoria <br>
                Amidst the black coal tar smell. <br>
                You call it magic <br>
                I feel Kolkata. <br></p>

            <h2>Kolkata,India</h2>
            <p>Those eyes reflect an ever pervading poverty,<br>
                A head burdened with the load of incessant negligence, <br>
                The lips get more sooty black, <br>
                With every drag, <br>
                Of the nicotinous smoke- <br>
                While a sense of fulfillment he tries to evoke. <br>
                The pangs of capitalism threatens to trample his stomach - <br>
                That is already torn apart with ravenous hunger. <br>
                But he's always been a fighter <br>
                And above all, <br>
                He's a survivor. <br></p>

            <h2>Kolkata,India</h2>
            <p>I lay trembling the entire night, as you tore me apart. <br>
                Cacophonous screams and cries, <br>
                Spilling like a volcano but all inside. I was helpless and tied to your charred boundaries. <br>
                Yes, my depression was the result of your eccentric fantasy. <br> Since then, skies became darker and it's all hollow inside, my bones are where milky way and andromeda collide. <br>
                I became a death star fighting the urge to hang myself each day with a tainted smile. <br>
                Destroying people isn't a souvenir but you're proud of it anyway and I abhor you for that, for letting myself convince that I admired you. <br>
                No. <br>
                I'm no longer the innocent flower you picked up from the street and casually destroyed, I'm only left with thorns now that will sting you bad when closer. <br>
                You see? I'm trying my best to battle against this agony and you, <br></p>
